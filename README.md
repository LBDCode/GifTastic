# GifTastic

 GifTastic is a simple app that utilizes the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/) to search for and play GIFs.

 You start by clicking one of the existing gif topic buttons, or searching for a new topic and clicking that.  This will populate the GIF circle.  You can then click on any GIF to play it.  Once you're done watching the GIF, click it again to dismiss it.

Playing GIFs also show the gif rating, and a heart icon that can be use to favorite the GIF.  Favorites are kept in localstorage.
